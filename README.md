VimProcessing
=============

Processing shortcuts for Vim

##Provides:
1. Java syntax highlighting for .pde files
2. A 'P5' command that runs a processing sketch from within vim using `processing-java`

##TODO
I need to learn how to add Processing specific highlighting based on the API, similar to the way that the Processing IDE performs.
